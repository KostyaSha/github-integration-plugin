== Pull Request Plugin

* By design it extensible and new features can be added easily
* Restriction features are not bundled into main code and can be extended separately. Available as API for doing checks from other plugin parts
* Trigger events are splitted to separate classes and can do:
** Label: added, removed, exists
** PR states: closed, opened, commit changed
** Comment triggering
* UI/configuration changes:
** No tones of checkboxes
** Trigger section contains only configuration related to triggering
** All messages configurable
* Publishers are in post-build actions:
** slitted to separate publishers to have ability choose required order
*** Set build status. Job can configured to not set PR statuses
*** Add labels
*** Remove labels
*** Close PR
*** Post comment with TokenMacro and Groovy Templates from https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[email-ext-plugin] support
* Trigger check modes:
** Cron checks with persistence
** Hooks with persistence
** Hooks with persistance and periodic cron check (to avoid lost events)
** (TBD) Light hooks triggering without persisting state (penalty: lost events)
* Built sources variants:
** Build only merged state. Note: merged to target branch only in moment when PR was built.
** Build only 'head' state. This is what is really contains in PR without merge to target branch.
** Conditional build with `GITHUB_PR_COND_REF`. When PR is mergeable it contains 'merge' word and 'head' when not.
* Persisted state is stored near build configuration in `*.runtime.xml` file to exclude useless saves with https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin[jobConfigHistory-plugin]
* All input variables starts from `GITHUB_PR_*`
* Refspec for https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin[git-plugin] is not hardcoded, branch specifier can be constructed using input variables
* Configuration and code tried to be workflow friendly
* Supports https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin[workflow-plugin]
* Integrates with https://github.com/jenkinsci/block-queued-job-plugin[block-queued-job-plugin]. Allows create gatekeeping.
* Integrated with https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin[github-plugin] optimized/reused code for:
** searching projects
** using one hook url
** almost one Global Configuration
** reused credentials lookup
* Integrates with https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin[job-dsl-plugin] https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-integration-plugin/blob/master/github-pullrequest-plugin/src/test/resources/dsl/jobdsl.groovy[example of job-dsl configuration]
