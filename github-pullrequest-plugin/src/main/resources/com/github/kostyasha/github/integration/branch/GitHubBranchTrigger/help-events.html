<div>
    GitHub events or statuses that should or should not trigger a build for branch.
    <br/>
    The specified events will be checked in order, and the first to match will
    be used, so be sure to put events/statuses that should prevent triggering a
    build first in order.
    <br/>
    If you want to skip PR, you must place skip events firstly.
