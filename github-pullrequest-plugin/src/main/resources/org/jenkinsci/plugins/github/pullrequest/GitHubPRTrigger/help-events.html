<div>
    GitHub events or statuses that should or should not trigger a build of a pull request.
    <br/>
    The specified events will be checked in order, and the first to match will
    be used, so be sure to put events/statuses that should prevent triggering a
    build first in order.
    <br/>
    For performance reasons, "Pull Request Opened" should go before other
    events that require more detailed checking of the pull request, such as
    "Comment Matched to Pattern".
